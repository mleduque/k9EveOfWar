      Note: If Bentley is dead as a result of the actions from the Cyric quest then you must go through Gellana.

He will only give you this quest if the ceremony has already happened. From his point of view Sarevok is finished, as is the iron Throne, and with this move half of the dukes in the city (and quite possibly all of them) will be dead. If he can pin this on the Zhents it may trigger a war between Amn and Baldur&apos;s Gate, but it is just as likely to cause any agents of Amn serious difficulties in operating within the city. Alatos is basically looking to use this opportunity in order to acquire the assets of the Iron Throne while simultaneously weakening any amnian thieves guild influence in the city. He figure that any war will likely only cause the destruction of Beregost (at most).">
